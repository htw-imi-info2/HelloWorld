# HelloWorld
HelloWorld Examples from the Command Line and from Eclipse.

This repository contains the complete Eclipse Workspace as well as the class files (which wouldn't be included in version controll as they are generated files).

Try to create both yourself rather than downloading and running this, but if you missed something, you can peek here.
